          Koreatown is a neighborhood located a little west of Downtown Los Angeles. This neighborhood has been
          historically known to reside low-income and immigrant families. However, there has been an increase in
          gentrification. Many landlords have sold their properties to developers. These developers evict tenants to
          remodel buildings or construct newer buildings. This has led to the displacement of those who cannot afford
          these high rents. A place that was once known to be a safe place for low-income families has turned into an
          increasingly gentrified and expensive neighborhood. It is extremely important to spread awareness due to the
          increase in rents. Many people end up looking for other places to live and they are no longer locals of the
          area in which they once resided.

    <h4> The Solution </h4>
    <section id="TheSolution" class="flex-container2">
      <div class="solutions">
        <ul>

          <li>
            Tenant Protections: City and States should increase legal protection for tenants. These
            can include things like protection from unfair evictions and ensuring tenant rights. Tenants should also be
            provided with legal aid and support.
          </li>
          <li>
            Affordable Housing Policies: States should implement and enforce rent control policies
            that prevent intense rent increases. Affordable housing policies should also include affordable housing
            programs that provide affordable housing to low-income families. These could come in the form of requiring
            developers
            to include a certain percentage of affordable units in new buildings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Raise Community Voices: Engage members of the community in the planning and
            decision-making process to ensure that newer projects meet their needs.
          </li>

    <h2>Optimism for the future </h2>
    <section id="TheFuture">
      <p id="concludingparagraph">
        Gentrification in Koreatown will continue to increase. However, as previously mentioned, residents must unite
        and
        advocate for their community. Unity to save the culture of Koreatown is needed. Only then will voices be heard
        and
        more policies implemented. Affordable housing initiatives and inclusionary zoning are achievable. There can be
        gradual change, but only if residents stand up for the needs of their community.
